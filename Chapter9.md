# Chapter 9 - Implementing Incident Response
Numerous books and publications recognize culture as a very important factor influencing all aspects of an organization. Both SRE and SRE transformation are among those aspects that are greatly influenced by organizational culture. The speed with which SRE will be allowed to spread will not be determined by the project plans, executive wishes, or SRE coaches’ hopes. Rather, it will be determined by the organizational culture to a great extent.

According to the Longman Dictionary, one definition of culture is: “the beliefs, way of life, art, and customs that are shared and accepted by people in a particular society.”4 Sociologist Ron Westrum defined a popular topology of organizational cultures, often referred to as the Westrum model,5 which classifies cultures as pathological, bureaucratic, or generative according to how organizations process information: Pathological cultures are power oriented, bureau- cratic cultures are rule oriented, and generative cultures are performance oriented. According to DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA6), performance-oriented generative cultures also lead to high performance in software delivery. According to the Westrum model, there are six aspects of a generative culture:

1. High cooperation
2. Messengers are trained
3. Risks are shared
4. Bridging is encouraged
5. Failure leads to inquiry
6. Novelty is implemented
