- 1.1.2 COBIT
COBIT is a framework created by ISACA, it defines a set of eneric processes for the management of IT, with each process defined together with process inputs and outputs, key process-activities, process objectives, performance measures and an elementary maturity model. 
1. Meeting stakeholder needs
2. Covering the enterprise end-to-end
3. Applying a single integrated framework
4. Enabling a holistic approach
5. Separating governance from management 

ISACA released COBIT in 1996. The latest version, COBIT 2019, was released in 2018 and define six governance system principles. 

1. Provide stakeholder value
2. Holistic approach 
3. Dynamic governance system
4. Governance distinct from management
